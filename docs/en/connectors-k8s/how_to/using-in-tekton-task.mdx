# Using Kubernetes Connector in Tekton Task

Using Kubernetes Connector in Tekton Tasks enables centralized management of tool integration information and secure access to Kubernetes clusters during Tekton Task execution.

## Requirements for Tekton Task

Not all Tekton Tasks can use Kubernetes Connector.

Kubernetes Connector essentially injects temporary Kubernetes credentials through a Connector CSI Driver. It provides a configuration named `kubeconfig` that generates a `kubeconfig` file with temporary authentication.

Therefore, Tekton Tasks must meet the following requirements to use Kubernetes Connector:

**Support mounting a `kubeconfig` file via Workspace, and the Workspace must support providing only the `kubeconfig` file**

## Usage Instructions

After confirming that your Tekton Task can use Kubernetes Connector, you can add Kubernetes Connector to the TaskRun YAML file:

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: k8s-connector-demo
spec:
  # .  . .
  workspaces:
  - name: kubeconfig
    csi:
      driver: connectors-csi
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        connector.name: k8s-connector
        connector.namespace: ""
        configuration.names: "kubeconfig"
```

For workspaces parameters, please refer to [Using Connectors CSI Driver to mount kubeconfig file](../concepts/k8s_connectorclass.mdx#using-connectors-csi-driver-to-mount-kubeconfig-file) in Kubernetes Connector Concepts document.

For more information about Connectors CSI Driver, please refer to [Connectors CSI Configuration](../../connectors/concepts/connectors_csi.mdx).
