# Introduction

## What is Kubernetes Connector

Kubernetes Connector is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with Kubernetes clusters, allowing users to interact with Kubernetes clusters secretlessly in clients like `kubectl`.

Once Kubernetes Connector Component is deployed, users can:

- Create Kubernetes connectors to integrate with various Kubernetes clusters
- Perform kubernetes operations in CI/CD pipelines or kubernetes workloads without directly handling credentials.

## Application Scenarios

The Kubernetes Connector allows you to perform kubernetes operations securely by:

- Managing credentials centrally rather than hardcoding them in clients
- Automatically injecting authentication during the kubernetes operations

This approach is particularly useful for:

- `CI/CD pipelines` or `kubernetes jobs` requiring access kubernetes resources
- Teams sharing kubernetes cluster access without sharing credentials
- Environments requiring centralized management of kubernetes credentials without distributing credentials to each client
