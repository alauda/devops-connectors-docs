# Upgrading `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator


This document provides instructions for upgrading the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator to a newer version using the `Marketplace`/`OperatorHub` interface in your cluster. The upgrade process is designed to be straightforward while ensuring minimal disruption to existing resources.

## Upgrade Overview

Upgrading the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator allows you to access new features, bug fixes, and improvements to its components. The `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator handles the upgrade of all components according to your configuration.

## Before You Begin

Before upgrading the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator, ensure you:

- Have administrative access to your cluster
- Review the release notes for the new version to understand any breaking changes
- Verify that your existing Connector components configurations are compatible with the new version
- Confirm that all current components are in a ready state

## Upgrade Process

### Using `Marketplace`/`OperatorHub`

1. **Access the `Marketplace`/`OperatorHub`**
   - Log in to your cluster's management console
   - Navigate to the `Marketplace` or `OperatorHub` section

2. **Locate the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator**
   - Search for `Alauda DevOps Connectors` in the search bar
   - Click on the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` card

3. **View Available Versions**
   - On the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator details page, you'll see information about the currently installed version
   - The interface will indicate if a newer version is available
   - You can click different `Channels` to view all available versions

4. **Initiate the Upgrade**
   - If the target version is in a different `Channel`, switch to the corresponding `Channel` in the `Subscription` first
   - If the current `Channel` has a newer version available, you will see a prompt:
     - **New Version Detected**
       - To upgrade only the current Operator, click `Confirm` to upgrade.

5. **Configure Upgrade Settings (if applicable)**
   - Some upgrades may present configuration options
   - In most cases, the default settings will preserve your existing configuration

6. **Confirm and Start the Upgrade**
   - Click `Confirm` to begin the process
   - Review the upgrade details and confirm your selection
   - The system will update the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator while maintaining your custom resources

7. **Monitor the Upgrade**
   - The upgrade progress will be displayed in the `OperatorHub` interface
   - You can also check the status in the `connectors-operator` namespace:
     ```bash
     $ kubectl get pods -n connectors-operator
     ```
     When all pods are in `Running` state, the operator upgrade is complete.
     The operator will then automatically upgrade components such as `ConnectorCore`, `ConnectorsGit`, `ConnetorsOCI`, etc.
   - Check the components upgrade status:
     ```bash
     $ kubectl get installmanifest -n connectors-operator
     $ kubectl get pods -n connectors-operator
     ```
     When all components and pods are in `Ready` state, the components upgrade is complete.

8. **Verify the Upgrade**
   - Check that the `Alauda DevOps Connnectors` Operator version has been updated:
     ```bash
     $ kubectl get csv -n connectors-operator

     NAME                         DISPLAY                    VERSION   REPLACES                     PHASE
     connectors-operator.v1.y.z   Alauda DevOps Connectors   1.y.z     connectors-operator.v1.y.z   Succeeded
     ```
     When the `VERSION` matches the new version, the upgrade is complete.
   - Verify that all Connector components are functioning correctly


## Post-Upgrade Steps

After the upgrade completes successfully:

1. **Verify Component Status**
   - Check that all Connectors components have been updated:
     ```bash
     kubectl get connectorscore,connectorsgit,connectorsoci -A
     ```

2. **Test Functionality**
   - Run a job using connector csi or deploy an app pulling the image through oci connector to verify that the system is working correctly
   - Ensure that all existing integrations continue to function

3. **Update Custom Resources if Needed**
   - If the new version introduces changes to CRDs, you may need to update your custom resources
   - Refer to the release notes for specific migration steps

## Rollback Procedure

If you encounter issues with the new version, you can roll back to the previous version:

1. Return to the `Marketplace`/`OperatorHub` interface
2. Select the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` Operator
3. `Uninstall` the current version
4. Choose the previous version from the version list
5. Follow the installation process for that version

:::note
Downgrading may require additional steps to ensure compatibility of your resources with the older version.

This depends on the differences between the version you upgraded from and the version you upgraded to. If the differences are large, you may need to manually migrate resources.
