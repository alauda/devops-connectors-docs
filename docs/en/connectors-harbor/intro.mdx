# Introduction

## What is Harbor Connector

Harbor Connector is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with Harbor Registry, allowing users to interact with Harbor Registry without handling credentials in clients.

Once Harbor Connector Component is deployed, users can:

- Create Harbor connectors to integrate with various Harbor Registries
- Perform container image operations in CI/CD pipelines or Kubernetes workloads without directly handling credentials.

## Application Scenarios

The Harbor Connector allows you to perform container image operations securely by:

- Managing credentials centrally rather than hardcoding them in clients
- Automatically injecting authentication during the container image operations

This approach is particularly useful for:

- `CI/CD pipelines` or `kubernetes jobs` requiring access to Harbor Registry
- Teams sharing Harbor Registry access without sharing credentials
- Environments requiring centralized management of Harbor Registry credentials without distributing credentials to each client
