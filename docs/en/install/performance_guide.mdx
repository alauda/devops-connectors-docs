# Performance Guide

This guide describes the observed performance characteristics of the Connectors system under load and provides recommendations for high-concurrency environments.

:::info
The following observations are from internal testing. Actual performance may vary depending on your cluster resources and workload.
:::

- **Connector status updates**: No observable delay when managing 1,000 connectors simultaneously.
- **Forward proxy (HTTPS)**: Introduces a small amount of additional latency at 50 concurrent requests. Latency increases gradually as concurrency rises.
- **Forward proxy (HTTP)**: Introduces a small amount of additional latency at 50 concurrent requests. Latency increases slowly with higher concurrency.
- **Reverse proxy**: Introduces minimal additional latency at 50 concurrent requests that grows slowly under load.
- **All proxy modes at 100 concurrent requests**: Latency increases but the system remains stable without errors or crashes.
- **OCI/Harbor image push/pull (HTTP forward proxy)**: No significant performance degradation observed across a wide range of concurrent operations; validated with Harbor's official benchmark tool.

## Performance Configuration

If you experience slow proxy requests or occasional failures under high load, apply the following configuration to increase throughput.

- **Scale replicas** for the `connectors-proxy`, `connectors-controller-manager`, `connectors-api`, and plugin components.
- **Increase `-kube-api-qps` and `-kube-api-burst`** to raise the request rate limit to the Kubernetes API.

Example configuration for ConnectorsCore and ConnectorsOCI:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: ConnectorsCore
metadata:
  name: connectors-core
  namespace: connectors-system
spec:
  workloads:
  - name: connectors-proxy
    replicas: 2
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: proxy
          args:
          - --metrics-bind-address=:8443
          - -kube-api-qps=60
          - -kube-api-burst=80
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 100Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 250m
              memory: 250Mi
  - name: connectors-controller-manager
    replicas: 2
  - name: connectors-api
    replicas: 2

apiVersion: operator.connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: ConnectorsOCI
metadata:
  name: connectors-oci
  namespace: connectors-system
spec:
  workloads:
  - name: connectors-oci-plugin
    replicas: 2
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: plugin
          args:
          - -metrics-bind-address=:8082
