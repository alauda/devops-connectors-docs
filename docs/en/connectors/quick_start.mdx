# Quick Start

This document will help you quickly understand and use the Connectors system.

## Introduction

### Applicable Scenarios

The Connectors system provides a unified way to securely manage connections to external systems across your Kubernetes cluster. By using connectors, you can:

- Centralize credential management for external services
- Eliminate hardcoded credentials in application code
- Ensure consistent access patterns across your organization
- Monitor and audit service connections in one place

This guide uses GitHub as an example, but the same principles apply to connecting to other services.

### Estimated Reading Time

10-15 minutes

## Notes

- This quick start assumes you already have the Connectors Operator, ConnectorsCore, and ConnectorsGit components installed in your cluster. See the [Installation Guide](../install) for detailed installation instructions.
- You need a GitHub account and a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions.
- Connector status reflects the health and accessibility of the connection.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with the following components installed:
  - Connectors Operator
  - ConnectorsCore
  - ConnectorsGit
- kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
- GitHub account and valid Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes resources

## Process Overview

| No. | Operation Step | Description |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Verify Required Components | Ensure connector infrastructure is properly installed |
| 2 | Create Authentication Secret | Create a Kubernetes Secret with GitHub credentials |
| 3 | Create GitHub Connector | Configure a connector to GitHub |
| 4 | Verify Connector Status | Check if the connector is ready for use |

## Steps to Operate

### Step 1: Verify Required Components

Before creating a GitHub connector, verify that the connector infrastructure is properly installed in your cluster.

1. Check that the Connectors Operator, ConnectorsCore, and ConnectorsGit are installed:

   ```bash
   kubectl get connectorscore -A
   kubectl get connectorsgit -A
   ```

   You should see both resources with a status of "Ready".

2. Verify that the Git ConnectorClass exists:

   ```bash
   kubectl get connectorclass git
   ```

   If the Git ConnectorClass is not found, you need to install ConnectorsGit first. See the [Installation Guide](../install) for instructions.

### Step 2: Create Authentication Secret

Create a Kubernetes Secret containing the credentials for GitHub.

1. Execute the following command to create a Secret with your GitHub credentials:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic github-auth \
     --namespace default \
     --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth \
     --from-literal=username=your-github-username \
     --from-literal=password=your-github-token
   ```

   Replace `your-github-username` with your GitHub username and `your-github-token` with your GitHub Personal Access Token.

2. Verify that the Secret was successfully created:

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret github-auth -n default
   ```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Connector

Create a connector to GitHub using the Git ConnectorClass.

1. Save the following YAML as `github-connector.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Connector
   metadata:
     name: github-connector
     namespace: default
   spec:
     connectorClassName: git
     address: "https://github.com"
     auth:
       name: basicAuth
       secretRef:
         name: github-auth
         namespace: default
   ```

2. Apply the connector:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f github-connector.yaml
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Connector Status

After creating the connector, check its status to ensure it's functioning correctly.

1. Use the following command to check the connector status:

   ```bash
   kubectl get connector github-connector -n default
   ```

2. To view detailed status information, use:

   ```bash
   kubectl get connector github-connector -n default -o yaml
   ```

### Expected Results

After successfully completing all steps, you will see the following results:

1. The GitHub connector resource status shows as "Ready":

   ```
   NAME               CLASS   ADDRESS              READY   AGE
   github-connector   git     https://github.com   True    2m
   ```

2. All conditions in the detailed status information are "True":

   ```yaml
   status:
     conditions:
     - type: ConnectorClassReady
       status: "True"
     - type: SecretReady
       status: "True"
     - type: LivenessReady
       status: "True"
     - type: AuthReady
       status: "True"
     - type: ProxyServiceReady
       status: "True"
     - type: Ready
       status: "True"
   ```

3. If the connector has proxy functionality configured, you will also see a proxy address in the status:

   ```yaml
   status:
     proxy:
       httpAddress:
         url: http://c-github-connector.default.svc.cluster.local
   ```

Now, you have successfully created a GitHub connector and verified that it works.

Your applications can use this connector to securely access GitHub repositories without embedding credentials directly in application code.

## Troubleshooting

If your connector doesn't reach the "Ready" status, check the following:

1. **ConnectorClass Availability**: Ensure the Git ConnectorClass exists:
   ```bash
   kubectl get connectorclass git
   ```
   If it doesn't exist, you need to install ConnectorsGit. See the [Installation Guide](../../install).

2. **Authentication Configuration**: Ensure the credentials in the Secret are correct and have appropriate permissions.

3. **Repository Accessibility**: Verify that the repository specified in the auth params exists and is accessible with the provided credentials.

4. **Check Controller Logs**: Review the connector controller logs for detailed error information:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n connectors-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=connectors-controller-manager
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first connector, you can:

- Create connectors for other Git services (GitLab, Harbor, etc.)
- Configure applications to use the connector for secure access to Git repositories
