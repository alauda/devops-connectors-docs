# Architecture

![Architecture](./assets/arch.drawio.png)

## Connector

`Connector` is a resource that represents an integrated instance of a specific tool. By configuring the tool's access URL and authentication information, we can create an instance for the tool's integration.

For example, integrating `https://github.com` using a `GitHub Private Access Token` is achieved through a `Connector`.

In `Kubernetes`, `Connector` is a namespace-level custom resource. Users can create multiple `Connectors` within the same namespace to integrate different tools.

For instance, within the `default` namespace, it is possible to create both a `Connector` for integrating `https://github.com` and a `Connector` for integrating `https://hub.docker.com/`.

Platform administrators can manage tool integrations across the cluster by managing `Connector` resources.

## ConnectorClass

`ConnectorClass` defines the access methods and behavior specifications for specific types of tools. It stipulates the parameters required when integrating with a certain type of tool, such as tool address and authentication information.

For example, the `Git ConnectorClass` defines the configuration items that need to be provided when integrating with Git tools, including the Git service's address and `Basic-Auth` authentication information.

In `Kubernetes`, `ConnectorClass` is a cluster-level custom resource. Developers can extend the types of tools supported by the platform by defining new `ConnectorClasses`.

For example, a `Harbor ConnectorClass` can be defined to support integration with the Harbor image repository, a `MySQL ConnectorClass` can be defined to support integration with MySQL databases, or a `Jira ConnectorClass` can be defined to support integration with Jira project management tools.

## Connectors Proxy

`ConnectorsProxy` is a core component of the `Connectors` system that provides a secure, secretless way to access integrated tools within a Kubernetes cluster. It acts as a proxy server that handles authentication and routing of requests to the actual tool endpoints.

`ConnectorsProxy` enables clients to access tool resources without needing to handle authentication credentials directly. This significantly improves security by:

- Eliminates the need to distribute tool credentials directly to clients by using short-lived tokens issued by ServiceAccount.
- Preventing credential exposure in logs or environment variables
- Centralizing credential management

It supports various protocols and can handle different types of tool integrations:

- HTTP/HTTPS protocols for REST APIs
- Git protocol witch HTTP Basic Auth for code repositories server (e.g. GitHub, GitLab)
- OCI protocol witch Bearar Token Authorization for OCI registries (e.g. Harbor, Docker Registry)

## Connectors API

`Connectors API` provides capabilities for accessing internal tool resources based on `Connector` instances. For example, for a `Git Connector`, the `Connectors API` can retrieve the list of branches (References) in a Git repository.

Developers can conveniently access resources within tools via the `Connectors API` without needing to concern themselves with specific tool addresses and authentication details.

This API is very useful in practical applications, such as:

- Retrieving the list of tags for container images when creating applications
- Getting the list of branches (References) for a code repository during a Git Clone operation

The implementation of the `Connectors API` is based on the underlying capabilities provided by the `ConnectorClass API`.

# ConnectorClass API

`ConnectorClass API` defines the APIs provided by specific types of tools.

Different types of tools can offer various API capabilities, for example:

- The `Git ConnectorClass API` can provide the capability to retrieve the list of branches for a code repository
- The `OCI ConnectorClass API` can provide the capability to retrieve the list of tags for artifact repositories

Developers can define unique API capabilities for each `ConnectorClass`, and these capabilities will ultimately be exposed to clients through the `Connectors API`.

# Connectors CSI Driver

To facilitate easier utilization of Connectors-Proxy capabilities by K8S workloads, we can use the Connectors CSI Driver.

The Connectors CSI Driver can mount the rendered contents of the configuration file templates maintained within the ConnectorClass into the workload. The configuration file can include information for accessing the `Connectors Proxy`, enabling users to utilize Connectors Proxy capabilities with minimal modifications to their original scripts.
