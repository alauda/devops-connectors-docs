# ConnectorsProxy

ConnectorsProxy is a core component of the Connectors system that provides a secure, secretless way to access integrated tools within a Kubernetes cluster. It acts as a proxy server that handles authentication and routing of requests to the actual tool endpoints.

## Features

### Secretless Access

ConnectorsProxy enables clients to access tool resources without needing to handle authentication credentials directly. This significantly improves security by:

- Eliminating the need to distribute credentials to workloads
- Preventing credential exposure in logs or environment variables
- Centralizing credential management

### Automatic Service Creation

When a Connector is created, ConnectorsProxy automatically:

1. Creates a Kubernetes Service for proxy purposes
2. Assigns a proxy address in the format: `http://c-{connector-name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local`
3. Records the proxy address in the Connector's `status.proxy.httpAddress` field

### Protocol Support

ConnectorsProxy supports various protocols and can handle different types of tool integrations:

- HTTP/HTTPS protocols for REST APIs
- Git protocol witch HTTP Authorization for code repositories
- OCI protocol witch Bearar Token Authorization for container registries

## Usage

### Accessing Tool Resources

To use ConnectorsProxy, clients should:

1. Use the proxy address instead of the original tool address
2. Configure their clients to work with the proxy (if required)
3. Access resources through the proxy endpoint

Example for an OCI Registry:

```yaml
# Original image address
harbor.example.com/test/abc:v1

# Proxied address
c-harbor-connector.default.svc.cluster.local/test/abc:v1
```

### Configuration

ConnectorsProxy can be configured through the ConnectorClass definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: ConnectorClass
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  proxy:
    ref:
      kind: Service
      name: connectors-proxy-service
      namespace: connectors-system
```

## Integration with CSI Driver

ConnectorsProxy works seamlessly with the Connectors CSI Driver to provide a complete secretless access solution:

1. The CSI Driver mounts necessary configuration files
2. ConnectorsProxy handles the actual proxying of requests
3. Clients can access resources without credential management

This integration is particularly useful in scenarios like:

- Git clone operations in Kubernetes Jobs
- Image push/pull operations in Tekton Pipelines
- API access in custom workloads

## Security Considerations

ConnectorsProxy enhances security by:

1. Centralizing credential management
2. Preventing credential exposure in workloads
3. Supporting TLS encryption for proxy connections
4. Implementing proper authentication and authorization
