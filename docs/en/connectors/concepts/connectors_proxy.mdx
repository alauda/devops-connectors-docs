# ConnectorsProxy

`ConnectorsProxy` is a core component that provides secure, secretless access to integrated tools within Kubernetes clusters. It acts as a proxy server, handling authentication injection and request routing to target tool.

`ConnectorsProxy` enables clients to access tool resources without direct credential handling. This approach delivers significant security benefits:

- **Secretless Access**: Eliminates the need to distribute tool credentials directly to clients by using short-lived tokens issued by ServiceAccount. This prevents credential exposure in clients like logs or environment variables.
- **Centralized Credential Management**: All tool credentials are managed centrally by connectors, and no need to distribute credentials to each client.

The platform supports both built-in and custom proxy implementations to accommodate diverse tool authentication requirements.

## Built-in Connectors Proxy

The built-in `ConnectorsProxy` implementation provides comprehensive HTTP/HTTPS protocol support with Basic Auth and Bearer Token authentication methods. It offers both forward proxy and reverse proxy capabilities.

### Forward Proxy

Operates as a standard HTTP proxy using `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables. When the proxy receives client requests, it:

1. Authenticates the client
2. Injects tool credentials specified in the Connector into the request if current request path is pointing to the target tool specified by the Connector
3. Forwards the authenticated request to the target tool

:::danger

Connectors Proxy does not support the `CONNECT` method for `HTTP tunneling`. Clients must send HTTP requests directly to the proxy server.

:::

### Reverse Proxy

Clients access tools by connecting directly to the Connector Proxy Address instead of the original tool URL. The proxy:

1. Receives client requests at the proxy endpoint
2. Performs client authentication
3. Injects tool credentials specified in the Connector and forwards requests to the backend tool

## Custom Connectors Proxy

For tools requiring specialized authentication mechanisms, custom proxy implementations can be developed. These proxies can be implemented as either forward or reverse proxies based on specific requirements.

**Example**: The OCI Connector uses a custom OCI Plugin Proxy that supports OCI protocol with Bearer Token authorization for registries like Harbor and Docker Registry.

User can develop a custom proxy server and specified in the connectorclass.

## Connector Proxy Address

Each `Connector` has a unique proxy address for accessing tool resources. The proxy address is stored in the `status.proxy.httpAddress` field:

``` yaml
apiVersion: connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: Connector
metadata:
  name: github
spec:
  address: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git
  auth:
    name: basicAuth
    params:
    - name: repository
      value: kubernetes/kubernetes.git
  connectorClassName: git
status:
  # . . .
  proxy:
    httpAddress:
      url: http://c-github.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Clients use this proxy address to access resources within the tool specified by the Connector.

For more fields about connectorclass, please refer to [ConnectorClass](./connectorclass.mdx#connectorclass_proxy)

## Use with Connectors CSI Driver

`Connectors Proxy` works seamlessly with the Connectors CSI Driver to provide a complete secretless access solution:

1. The Connectors CSI Driver mounts necessary configuration files that contains the proxy address and proxy authentication information
2. `Connectors Proxy` handles authentication injection and request routing to target tool.
3. Clients can access resources without credential management.

This integration is particularly useful in scenarios like:

- Git clone operations in Kubernetes Jobs
- Image push/pull operations in Tekton Pipelines
- API access in custom workloads

For complete secretless access scenarios using `Connectors Proxy` and `Connectors CSI Driver`, see [How to use the Git Connector to complete Git clone without storing credentials on the client](../../connectors-git/how_to/use-git-connector-in-clone-job.mdx)

## Deep Understanding of Connectors Proxy \{#deeps-understanding-connectors-proxy}

### Specifying Proxy in ConnectorClass

You can specify the proxy server to use in the ConnectorClass:

``` yaml
apiVersion: connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: ConnectorClass
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  proxy:
    ref:
      kind: Service
      name: connectors-proxy-service
      namespace: connectors-system
```

Connectors created from this ConnectorClass will use `connectors-proxy-service` as their real proxy server.

**Built-in Proxy Configuration:**

``` yaml
ref:
  kind: Service
  name: connectors-proxy-service
  namespace: <connector-namespace> # Namespace where Connector components are deployed
```

**Custom Proxy Configuration:**

Custom proxies can point to any address capable of handling proxy requests.

### Connectors Proxy Authentication

When using Connectors Proxy, clients must provide proper authentication credentials to access the proxy. The authentication process requires two key elements:

1. **Connector Identification**: Specify which connector to use for credential injection
2. **Authorization Token**: Provide a ServiceAccount token with read permissions for the target Connector

The proxy server validates the provided ServiceAccount token to ensure it has the necessary permissions for the specified Connector before processing requests and injects the authentication credentials into the request when valid.

For detailed information about ServiceAccount tokens and RBAC configuration, see the [Kubernetes Authentication documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens).

#### Built-in Forward Proxy Authentication

For forward proxy mode, authentication information is passed through the `Proxy-Authorization` header using HTTP Proxy Basic Authentication.

- **Username**: `<connector-namespace>/<connector-name>`
- **Password**: ServiceAccount token with read permissions for the Connector

Proxy-Authorization Header:

```bash
# credentials format: <connector-namespace>/<connector-name>:<service-account-token>
# example: default/github:sa-token-xxxxxxx
Proxy-Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

HTTP Proxy Environment Example:

You can configure proxy authentication using standard HTTP proxy environment variables:

```bash
export http_proxy=http://<connector-namespace>%2F<connector-name>:<service-account-token>@<connector-proxy-address>
export https_proxy=http://<connector-namespace>%2F<connector-name>:<service-account-token>@<connector-proxy-address>
```

> **Note**: The `%2F` is the URL-encoded form of `/` in the connector namespace/name format.

#### Built-in Reverse Proxy Authentication

For reverse proxy mode, clients connect directly to the connector's proxy address. The authentication token can be provided using either Basic Auth or Bearer Token methods, while connector identification is handled through the connector proxy address.

##### Basic Authentication

- **Username**: Any value (ignored)
- **Password**: ServiceAccount token with read permissions for the Connector

Example:

```bash
curl -u "user:sa-token-xxxxxxx" "http://c-github.default.svc.cluster.local/"
```

##### Bearer Token Authentication

- **Authorization Header**: `Bearer <service-account-token>`

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sa-token-xxxxxxx" "http://c-github.default.svc.cluster.local/"
```

##### Connector Identification

The connector can be identified through different proxy address formats:

- **Service Format**: e.g. `http://c-<connector-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`
- **Path Format**: `http://<proxy-address>/namespaces/<connector-namespace>/connectors/<connector-name>`

The connector proxy address is automatically generated by the system and is unique for each connector. You **must** retrieve the connector proxy address from the `status.proxy.httpAddress` field of the connector resource before using it.

Example:

For a `github` connector in the `default` namespace:

```bash
# Using Bearer Token and service address format
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sa-token-xxxxxxx" \
     "http://c-github.default.svc.cluster.local/"

# Using Basic Auth and path address format
curl -u ":sa-token-xxxxxxx" \
     "http://connector-proxy.example.com/namespaces/default/connectors/github"
```

The proxy will validate the authentication token and automatically inject the `default/github` connector's authentication credentials when forwarding requests to GitHub services.
