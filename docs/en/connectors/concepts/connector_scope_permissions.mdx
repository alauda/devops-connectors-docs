# Connector Resource Levels and Permissions

## Overview

In order to manage and utilize Connector resources from different levels to meet the demands of various organizational structures, the Connector system provides different levels of Connector resources and permission restrictions.

All Connector resources are utilized within the cluster and cannot be used across clusters. Within the current cluster, Connector resources are divided into three levels:

- Cluster Level
- Project Level (namespace group)
- Namespace Level

Resources created at different levels have different access permissions and are established under different namespaces.

- Cluster Level: Under the `kube-public` namespace, shared by the current cluster.
- Project Level: Under the namespace named after the project, shared within the current cluster for that projectâ€™s namespace.
- Namespace Level: Connectors in regular namespaces can only be accessed by the current namespace.

## Cluster Level

All Connector resources located under the `kube-public` namespace belong to the cluster level resources. Cluster level Connector resources can be accessed by all namespaces within the current cluster, making them shared across the cluster.

For instance, a Connector resource called `github-connector` created under the `kube-public` can be mounted by Pods in any namespace.

```yaml
kind: Pod
metadata:
  # . . .
  namespace: default
spec:
  # . . .
  volumes:
  - name: git-config
    csi:
      readOnly: true
      driver: connectors-csi
      volumeAttributes:
        connector.name: "github-connector"
        connector.namespace: "kube-public"
        configuration.names: "config"
```

## Namespace Level

Connectors created within a namespace are classified as namespace level resources. Namespace level Connector resources can only be accessed by the current namespace.

For example, a Connector resource called `github-connector` created in the `default` namespace can be mounted by Pods in the `default` namespace. However, if `ns-1` tries to access it, a permission denied error will occur.

```yaml
kind: Pod
metadata:
  # . . .
  namespace: default
spec:
  # . . .
  volumes:
  - name: git-config
    csi:
      readOnly: true
      driver: connectors-csi
      volumeAttributes:
        connector.name: "github-connector"
        connector.namespace: "default"
        configuration.names: "config"
```

## Project Level (Namespace Group)

The Connector system also offers a resource level that falls between the cluster level and the namespace level. This project level can also be understood as the Namespace Group level.

This level signifies that Pods within the associated namespaces can access Connectors under the same group. The group itself is represented by a special namespace, and the namespaces under the group are associated through labels.

- The namespace of the group itself is identified using the label `cpaas.io/inner-namespace: {group name}`.
- The namespaces under the group are identified with the label `cpaas.io/project: {group name}` indicating that the current namespace belongs to that group.

Project level resources can be accessed by namespaces within the group as well as by the namespace of the group itself. Other namespaces cannot access them.

For example, if there is a group named `group-1` with three namespaces: `ns1`, `ns2`, and `ns3`.

An example YAML is as follows:

```yaml
kind: namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: group-1
  labels:
    cpaas.io/inner-namespace: group-1
--
kind: namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ns1
  labels:
    cpaas.io/project: group-1
---
kind: namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ns2
  labels:
    cpaas.io/project: group-1
```

The `github-connector` resource under `group-1` can be accessed by:

- `ns1`, `ns2`, and `ns3` namespaces
- The `group-1` namespace itself
- Access from other namespaces to the Connector within `group-1` will result in a permission denied error.
