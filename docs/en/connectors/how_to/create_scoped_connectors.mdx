## How to Create Cluster-Level Connector Resources

Save the Connector resource under `kube-public`. For example,

```yaml
kind: Connector
metadata:
  name: github-connector
  namespace: kube-public
spec:
  address: https://github.com
  connectorClassName: git
  auth:
    name: baseAuth
    secretRef:
      name: github-secret
```

## How to Create Namespace-Level Connector Resources

Save the Connector resource under a regular namespace. For example,

```yaml
kind: Connector
metadata:
  name: github-connector
  namespace: default
spec:
  address: https://github.com
  connectorClassName: git
  auth:
    name: baseAuth
    secretRef:
      name: github-secret
```

## How to Create Project-Level Resources

Save the Connector resource under the namespace representing the current project.

```yaml
kind: Connector
metadata:
  name: github-connector
  namespace: project-1
spec:
  address: https://github.com
  connectorClassName: git
  auth:
    name: baseAuth
    secretRef:
      name: github-secret
```
