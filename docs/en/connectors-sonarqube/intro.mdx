# Introduction

## What is SonarQube Connector

SonarQube Connector is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with SonarQube platforms, allowing users to perform code quality analysis without handling authentication tokens directly in scanning tools.

Once SonarQube Connector is deployed, users can:

- Create SonarQube connectors to integrate with SonarQube instances
- Execute code quality scans in CI/CD pipelines or Kubernetes workloads without directly handling authentication tokens
- Perform security scanning and quality gate checks with centralized credential management

## Application Scenarios

The SonarQube Connector enables secure code quality analysis by:

- Managing SonarQube tokens centrally rather than hardcoding them in scanner configurations
- Automatically injecting authentication during scanning operations via proxy
- Supporting both self-hosted and managed SonarQube instances

This approach is particularly useful for:

- CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes jobs requiring code quality analysis
- Teams sharing SonarQube access without distributing authentication tokens
- Environments requiring centralized management of SonarQube credentials
- Organizations enforcing code quality policies across multiple projects
