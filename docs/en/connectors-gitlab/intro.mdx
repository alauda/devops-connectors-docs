# Introduction

## ConnectorsGitLab

**What is ConnectorsGitLab**

ConnectorsGitLab is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with GitLab servers. It extends the Connectors system with GitLab-specific capabilities, allowing users to use CLI tools (Git CLI, GitLab CLI, and custom CLI tools) to interact with GitLab without directly handling credentials.

**Feature Overview**

ConnectorsGitLab provides several key capabilities:

- Secure access to GitLab servers through credential abstraction using Private Access Tokens (PAT)
- Automatic credential injection for GitLab operations via CSI volumes

**Application Scenarios**

- Using Git CLI to securely clone private GitLab repositories in CI/CD pipelines
- Using GitLab CLI (glab) to interact with GitLab for merge request management, issue tracking, and API operations
- Using custom CLI tools (like reviewdog) to interact with GitLab for automated code review on merge requests
- Using CLI tools in container workloads to interact with GitLab without credential configuration
- Centralized management of GitLab access across multiple teams and projects
