# Introduction

## What is NPM Connector

NPM Connector is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with NPM Registry, allowing users to interact with NPM Registry without handling credentials in clients like `npm`.

Once NPM Connector Component is deployed, users can:

- Create NPM connectors to integrate with various NPM Registries (NPM repository hosted by Nexus, Artifactory, etc.)
- Perform `npm` operations in CI/CD pipelines or Kubernetes workloads without directly handling credentials.

## Application Scenarios

The NPM Connector allows you to perform `npm` operations securely by:

- Managing credentials centrally rather than hardcoding them in clients
- Automatically injecting authentication during the `npm` operations

This approach is particularly useful for:

- `CI/CD pipelines` or `kubernetes jobs` requiring access to NPM Registry
- Teams sharing NPM Registry access without sharing credentials
- Environments requiring centralized management of NPM Registry credentials without distributing credentials to each client
