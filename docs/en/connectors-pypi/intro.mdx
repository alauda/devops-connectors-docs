# Introduction

## What is PyPI Connector

PyPI Connector is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with PyPI Registry, allowing users to interact with PyPI Registry secretlessly in clients like `pip`, `twine`.

Once PyPI Connector Component is deployed, users can:

- Create PyPI connectors to integrate with various PyPI Registries (PyPI repository hosted by Nexus, Artifactory, etc.)
- Perform `pip` and `twine` operations in CI/CD pipelines or kubernetes workloads without directly handling credentials.

## Application Scenarios

The PyPI Connector allows you to perform `pip` and `twine` operations securely by:

- Managing credentials centrally rather than hardcoding them in clients
- Automatically injecting authentication during the `pip` and `twine` operations

This approach is particularly useful for:

- `CI/CD pipelines` or `kubernetes jobs` requiring access PyPI Registry
- Teams sharing PyPI Registry access without sharing credentials
- Environments requiring centralized management of PyPI Registry credentials without distributing credentials to each client
