# Introduction

## What is Maven Connector

Maven Connector is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with Maven Registry, allowing users to interact with Maven Registry secretlessly in clients like `mvn`.

Once Maven Connector Component is deployed, users can:

- Create Maven connectors to integrate with various Maven Registries (Maven Central, Maven repository hosted by Nexus, Artifactory, etc.)
- Perform `mvn` operations in CI/CD pipelines or kubernetes workloads without directly handling credentials.

## Application Scenarios

The Maven Connector allows you to perform `mvn` operations securely by:

- Managing credentials centrally rather than hardcoding them in clients
- Automatically injecting authentication during the `mvn` operations

This approach is particularly useful for:

- `CI/CD pipelines` or `kubernetes jobs` requiring access Maven Registry
- Teams sharing Maven Registry access without sharing credentials
- Environments requiring centralized management of Maven Registry credentials without distributing credentials to each client
