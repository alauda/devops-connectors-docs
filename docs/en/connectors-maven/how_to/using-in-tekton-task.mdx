# Using Maven Connector in Tekton Task

Using Maven Connector in Tekton Tasks enables centralized management of tool integration information and secure access to Maven registry during Tekton Task execution.

## Requirements for Tekton Task

Not all Tekton Tasks can use Maven Connector.

Maven Connector essentially injects temporary Maven credentials through a Connector CSI Driver. It provides a configuration named `settings` that generates a `settings.xml` file with temporary authentication and `ca.cert` file for trust the connector proxy server.

Therefore, Tekton Tasks must meet the following requirements to use Maven Connector:

**Support mounting a `settings.xml` and `ca.cert` file via Workspace**

## Usage Instructions

After confirming that your Tekton Task can use Maven Connector, you can add Maven Connector to the TaskRun YAML file:

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: maven-connector-demo
spec:
  # .  . .
  workspaces:
  - name: settings
    csi:
      driver: connectors-csi
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        connector.name: maven-connector
        connector.namespace: ""
        configuration.names: "settings"
  - name: cert
    csi:
      driver: connectors-csi
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        connector.name: maven-connector
        connector.namespace: ""
        configuration.names: "settings"
```

For workspaces parameters, please refer to [Using Connectors CSI Driver to mount settings.xml file](../concepts/maven_connectorclass.mdx#using-connectors-csi-driver-to-mount-settingsxml-file) in Maven Connector Concepts document.

For more information about Connectors CSI Driver, please refer to [Connectors CSI Configuration](../../connectors/concepts/connectors_csi.mdx).
