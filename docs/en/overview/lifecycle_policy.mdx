Below is the lifecycle timeline for released versions of the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` operator:

## Release Policy

A new minor version of the `Alauda DevOps Connectors` operator is released every month.

Within every 4-month period, the last minor version will be selected as a Long Term Support (LTS) version. LTS versions are supported for 12 months, while non-LTS versions are supported for 4 months.

Given that the Connectors are still under heavy development, the first LTS version will be released once the Connectors feature reaches maturity and stability.

## Maintenance Policy

Alauda provides 12 months of maintenance support for LTS released minor version of the Connectors operator.

During the maintenance period, the following support is included:

1. Providing patches that include critical bug fixes and security updates
2. Assist customers in smoothly upgrading to new versions

Alauda will release security version updates every two months during the maintenance period to ensure the security and stability of the operators.
