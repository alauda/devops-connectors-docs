# Feature Maturity

This page describes the current maturity level of each Connectors feature, helping you make informed decisions about which features are suitable for your environment.

## Maturity Levels

| Level     | Meaning                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Alpha** | Feature is in early development. Behavior and APIs may change without notice. Not recommended for production workloads.        |
| **Beta**  | Feature is functional and reasonably stable. Minor changes may occur with advance notice. Suitable for non-critical workloads. |
| **GA**    | Feature is stable and production-ready. APIs and behavior are stable across minor releases.                                    |

## Feature Maturity Overview

### Core Capabilities

| Feature           | Maturity |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Core Capabilities | Beta     |

Core Capabilities covers the foundational framework that all Connector types rely on, including: lifecycle management (create, update, delete), forward and reverse proxy for secret-less tool access, and direct tool API access through the Connector Proxy.

### Connector Classes

| Connector Class         | Maturity |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Git Connector           | Beta     |
| GitLab Connector        | Beta     |
| OCI Registry Connector  | Beta     |
| Harbor Connector        | Beta     |
| Maven Connector         | Beta     |
| PyPI Registry Connector | Beta     |
| NPM Registry Connector  | Beta     |
| Kubernetes Connector    | Beta     |
| SonarQube Connector     | Beta     |

### Advanced Features

| Feature                             | Maturity | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pipeline Resource Integration       | Alpha    | Provides a standard abstraction over tool resources (such as repositories, images, and artifacts), enabling them to be discovered and used within pipeline orchestration. |
| Custom ConnectorClass               | Alpha    | Extend Connectors with support for new tool types by defining custom ConnectorClass resources.                                                                            |
| Kubernetes Image Pull via Connector | Alpha    | Use OCI or Harbor Connectors to pull images for Kubernetes clusters in secret-less mode.                                                                                 |
