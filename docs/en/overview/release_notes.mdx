## v1.1.0

### Features and Enhancements

- Support using OCI Connector when pulling images in k8s. more details: [Using OCI Connector to Deploy Workloads in a Secretless Way](../connectors-oci/how_to/using_oci_connector_in_workload.mdx)
- Security updates: Updated base images, dependencies, and resolved security vulnerabilities

### Breaking Changes

#### OCI ConnectorClass resolver-type Change

The OCI connector image address format has been updated to provide better namespace isolation and resource management.
  
**Previous Format**: `c-connector.connector-ns.svc.cluster.local`

**New Format**: `connector.connector-ns.svc.cluster.local/namespaces/<connector-ns>/connectors/<connector-name>`

**Affected Scenarios**:
- **[Building Images Using OCI Connector in K8S Job](../connectors-oci/how_to/using_oci_connector_in_k8s_job.mdx)**: Image address changed from `c-harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/test/demo:v1` to `harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/namespaces/oci-connector-demo/connectors/oci-connector/test/demo:v1`
- **[Building Images Using OCI Connector in Tekton Pipeline](../connectors-oci/how_to/using_oci_connector_in_tekton_pipeline.mdx)**: Image address changed from `c-harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/test/demo:v1` to `harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/namespaces/oci-connector-demo/connectors/oci-connector/test/demo:v1`

**Upgrade Instructions**: Existing workloads using OCI connectors need to update their image address format to adapt to the new naming convention.

#### Services "c-xxx" already exist

After upgrading to v1.1.0, Connectors created in v1.0.8 may encounter the error: `services "c-xxx" already exist`

This issue occurs because the Service label associated with the Connector proxy has changed, preventing it from matching the old Service.

**Resolution**: Delete the service resource with the conflicting name, and the Connector status will automatically recover.
