## v1.6.0 (LTS)

### Features and Enhancements

**More Connectors**

- Support integration with GitLab Server by using GitLab Connector. more details:
  - [GitLab Connector Quick Start](../connectors-gitlab/quick_start.mdx)
- Support integration with NPM Registries by using NPM Connector. more details:
  - [NPM Connector Quick Start](../connectors-npm/quick_start.mdx)
- Support integration with Harbor Registries by using Harbor Connector. more details:
  - [Harbor Connector Quick Start](../connectors-harbor/quick_start.mdx)

**ResourceInterface for Pipeline Integration**

- Provides out-of-the-box definitions for `GitCodeRepository`, `OCIArtifact`, and `MavenArtifact` resources, enabling seamless integration of external resources (Git repositories, OCI artifacts, Maven artifacts) into TektonCD pipelines through a unified UI interface. For more details, see
  - [ResourceInterface](../connectors/concepts/resource_interface.mdx)
  - <ExternalSiteLink
      name="pipelines"
      href="/pipelines/concepts/integrate_with_connector.html"
      children="Pipeline Integration"
    />
- Support Dynamic Form in ResourceInterface for Pipeline Integration. For more details, see [ResourceInterface Dynamic Form](../connectors/concepts/resource_interface.mdx#dynamic-form).

**Connector API Enhancement**

- Support accessing tool's original API through the Connector API when the ConnectorClass provides Proxy Service capabilities. The system now supports two ways to access tool resources: using the tool's original API via Proxy Service, or using custom APIs provided for the ConnectorClass. For more details, see [Connector API](../connectors/concepts/connector_api.mdx).

**ConnectorClass Customization Flexibility**

- Support using Rego rules to extract tokens from client requests when using the built-in HTTP reverse proxy. Combined with the existing ability to inject authentication credentials into backend requests through Rego rules, you can now extend the built-in reverse proxy's capabilities to support tools with non-standard HTTP authentication mechanisms.
  - For token extraction configuration, see [Custom Rego-based Authentication](../connectors/concepts/connectors_proxy.mdx#custom-rego-based-authentication).
  - For authentication injection configuration, see [Injecting Authentication Credentials into Backend Request when using built-in Reverse Proxy](../connectors/concepts/connectors_proxy.mdx#injecting-authentication-when-using-built-in-reverse-proxy).
- Support using request variables in `spec.auth.types[].generator.rego` to inject authentication credentials into backend requests. more details: [Variables Available in Rego](../connectors/concepts/connectorclass.mdx#variables-available-in-rego).

**OCI Connector Forward Proxy**

- OCI Connector supports using forward proxy for image operations. For more details, see [OCI Connector Forward Proxy](../connectors-oci/concepts/oci_connectorclass.mdx#forward-proxy).

**CSI Driver Built-in Configurations**

- `Connectors CSI Driver` provides built-in configuration files that are always mounted into Pods. For more details, see [Built-in Configurations](../connectors/concepts/connectors_csi.mdx#built-in-configurations).

**Other Enhancements**

- Add docs to explain credential permissions required for each connector. more details: [Credential Permissions Required](../connectors-git/concepts/git_connectorclass.mdx#credential_permissions_required).

### Breaking Changes

- Remove the `input.xxx` variable from `spec.auth.types[].generator.rego`. Use `input.data.xxx` instead.

  - [Maven Connector Quick Start](../connectors-maven/quick_start.mdx)
  - [PyPI Connector Quick Start](../connectors-pypi/quick_start.mdx)
- Security updates: Updated base images, dependencies, and resolved security vulnerabilities

  - [Kubernetes Connector Quick Start](../connectors-k8s/quick_start.mdx)
  - [Understand Kubernetes Connector](../connectors-k8s/concepts/k8s_connectorclass.mdx)
  - [Using Kubernetes Connector in tektoncd pipelines](../connectors-k8s/how_to/using-in-tekton-task.mdx)

## v1.1.0

### Features and Enhancements

- Support using OCI Connector when pulling images in k8s. more details: [Using OCI Connector to Deploy Workloads in a Secretless Way](../connectors-oci/how_to/using_oci_connector_in_workload.mdx)
- Security updates: Updated base images, dependencies, and resolved security vulnerabilities

### Breaking Changes

#### OCI ConnectorClass resolver-type Change

The OCI connector image address format has been updated to provide better namespace isolation and resource management.

**Previous Format**: `c-connector.connector-ns.svc.cluster.local`

**New Format**: `connector.connector-ns.svc.cluster.local/namespaces/<connector-ns>/connectors/<connector-name>`

**Affected Scenarios**:

- **[Building Images Using OCI Connector in K8S Job](../connectors-oci/how_to/using_oci_connector_in_k8s_job.mdx)**: Image address changed from `c-harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/test/demo:v1` to `harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/namespaces/oci-connector-demo/connectors/oci-connector/test/demo:v1`
- **[Building Images Using OCI Connector in Tekton Pipeline](../connectors-oci/how_to/using_oci_connector_reverse_proxy_in_tekton_pipeline.mdx)**: Image address changed from `c-harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/test/demo:v1` to `harbor.default.svc.cluster.local/namespaces/oci-connector-demo/connectors/oci-connector/test/demo:v1`

**Upgrade Instructions**: Existing workloads using OCI connectors need to update their image address format to adapt to the new naming convention.

#### Services "c-xxx" already exist

After upgrading to v1.1.0, Connectors created in v1.0.8 may encounter the error: `services "c-xxx" already exist`

This issue occurs because the Service label associated with the Connector proxy has changed, preventing it from matching the old Service.

**Resolution**: Delete the service resource with the conflicting name, and the Connector status will automatically recover.

### Known Issues

{/* release-notes-for-bugs?template=unfixed&project=DEVOPS&version=v1.1.0 */}

## v1.0.8

### Features and Enhancements

- Security updates: Updated base images, dependencies, and resolved security vulnerabilities

### Fixed Issues

{/* release-notes-for-bugs?template=fixed&project=DEVOPS&version=v1.0.8 */}

### Known Issues

{/* release-notes-for-bugs?template=unfixed&project=DEVOPS&version=v1.0.8 */}

## v1.0.4

### Features and Enhancements

#### Alauda DevOps Connectors v1.0 (Alpha)

Connectors provide a secure and efficient way to connect to external services and tools and provide an unobtrusive way to integrate with them. Platform teams can easily and securely create connectors while keeping access secrets protected.

Out-of-the-box support:

- git repositories
- oci registries

Connectors also provide extensibility for custom connectors through the API and custom connectors implementation.
