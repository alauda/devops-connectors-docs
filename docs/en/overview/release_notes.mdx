## v1.8.0

### Features and Enhancements

- Connectors Core Capabilities and existing connectors (Git, OCI, Maven, PyPI, NPM, Kubernetes) have been promoted to Beta maturity level. For more details, see [Feature Maturity](../overview/feature_maturity.mdx).
- Add performance description and tuning guide to the documentation. For more details, see [Performance Guide](../install/performance_guide.mdx).

**Deprecation Notice**

- Added `registry-config` configuration to OCI and Harbor ConnectorClasses. The legacy `docker-config(oci)` and `config(harbor)` configuration is now deprecated but remains functional for backward compatibility. **It will be removed in a future release**. When mounting Connector configurations, use `registry-config` instead of `docker-config` or `config`.
- Added `registry-config` workspace to OCIArtifact and HarborOCIArtifact ResourceInterfaces. The legacy `docker-credentials` workspace is now deprecated but remains functional for backward compatibility. **It will be removed in a future release**.

**Security updates**

Updated base images, dependencies, and resolved security vulnerabilities

## v1.6.0 (LTS)

### Features and Enhancements

**More Connectors**

- Support integration with GitLab Server by using GitLab Connector. more details:
  - [GitLab Connector Quick Start](../connectors-gitlab/quick_start.mdx)
- Support integration with NPM Registries by using NPM Connector. more details:
  - [NPM Connector Quick Start](../connectors-npm/quick_start.mdx)
- Support integration with Harbor Registries by using Harbor Connector. more details:
  - [Harbor Connector Quick Start](../connectors-harbor/quick_start.mdx)

**ResourceInterface for Pipeline Integration**

- Provides out-of-the-box definitions for `GitCodeRepository`, `OCIArtifact`, and `MavenArtifact` resources, enabling seamless integration of external resources (Git repositories, OCI artifacts, Maven artifacts) into TektonCD pipelines through a unified UI interface. For more details, see
  - [ResourceInterface](../connectors/concepts/resource_interface.mdx)
  - <ExternalSiteLink
      name="pipelines"
      href="/pipelines/concepts/integrate_with_connector.html"
      children="Pipeline Integration"
    />
- Support Dynamic Form in ResourceInterface for Pipeline Integration. For more details, see [ResourceInterface Dynamic Form](../connectors/concepts/resource_interface.mdx#dynamic-form).

**Connector API Enhancement**

- Support accessing tool's original API through the Connector API when the ConnectorClass provides Proxy Service capabilities. The system now supports two ways to access tool resources: using the tool's original API via Proxy Service, or using custom APIs provided for the ConnectorClass. For more details, see [Connector API](../connectors/concepts/connector_api.mdx).

**ConnectorClass Customization Flexibility**

- Support using Rego rules to extract tokens from client requests when using the built-in HTTP reverse proxy. Combined with the existing ability to inject authentication credentials into backend requests through Rego rules, you can now extend the built-in reverse proxy's capabilities to support tools with non-standard HTTP authentication mechanisms.
  - For token extraction configuration, see [Custom Rego-based Authentication](../connectors/concepts/connectors_proxy.mdx#custom-rego-based-authentication).
  - For authentication injection configuration, see [Injecting Authentication Credentials into Backend Request when using built-in Reverse Proxy](../connectors/concepts/connectors_proxy.mdx#injecting-authentication-when-using-built-in-reverse-proxy).
- Support using request variables in `spec.auth.types[].generator.rego` to inject authentication credentials into backend requests. more details: [Variables Available in Rego](../connectors/concepts/connectorclass.mdx#variables-available-in-rego).

**OCI Connector Forward Proxy**

- OCI Connector supports using forward proxy for image operations. For more details, see [OCI Connector Forward Proxy](../connectors-oci/concepts/oci_connectorclass.mdx#forward-proxy).

**CSI Driver Built-in Configurations**

- `Connectors CSI Driver` provides built-in configuration files that are always mounted into Pods. For more details, see [Built-in Configurations](../connectors/concepts/connectors_csi.mdx#built-in-configurations).

**Other Enhancements**

- Add docs to explain credential permissions required for each connector. more details: [Credential Permissions Required](../connectors-git/concepts/git_connectorclass.mdx#credential_permissions_required).

### Breaking Changes

- Remove the `input.xxx` variable from `spec.auth.types[].generator.rego`. Use `input.data.xxx` instead.

  - [Maven Connector Quick Start](../connectors-maven/quick_start.mdx)
  - [PyPI Connector Quick Start](../connectors-pypi/quick_start.mdx)
