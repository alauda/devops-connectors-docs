# Quick Start

This document will help you quickly understand how to create a Git Connector and use it for securely cloning repositories without directly handling credentials.

## Introduction

### Applicable Scenarios

The Git Connector allows you to perform code cloning operations securely by:
- Managing credentials centrally rather than hardcoding them in workloads
- Automatically injecting authentication during the cloning process
- Providing controlled access to private repositories across teams

This approach is particularly useful for:
- CI/CD pipelines requiring secure access to private repositories
- Teams sharing repository access without sharing credentials
- Environments requiring centralized management of Git credentials

### Estimated Reading Time

15 minutes

## Notes

- The Git connector uses CSI driver integration to inject Git credentials securely.
- Connector-generated configurations expire after 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with Connectors system installed (Operator, Core and Git components). See the [Installation Guide](../install) for details on installing these components.
- kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
- Git repository with valid credentials (username/password or token)
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes resources

## Process Overview

| No. | Operation Step | Description |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Create Namespace | Create a dedicated namespace for the demonstration |
| 2 | Create Git Credentials and Connector | Set up the credentials and connector for Git access |
| 3 | Configure RBAC Permissions | Grant appropriate permissions to use the connector |
| 4 | Create a Clone Job | Deploy a job that uses the connector to clone a repository |
| 5 | Verify Operation | Check that the repository was successfully cloned |

## Steps to Operate

### Step 1: Create Namespace

Create a dedicated namespace for this demonstration:

```bash
kubectl create ns git-connector-demo
```

### Step 2: Create Git Credentials and Connector

Create both the Secret containing Git credentials and the Git Connector resource. For more detailed information about creating and configuring connectors, please refer to the [Connectors Quick Start Guide](../../connectors/quick_start).

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: git-auth
  namespace: git-connector-demo
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: your-username # Replace with your Git username
  password: your-token    # Replace with your Git password or token
---
apiVersion: connectors.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: Connector
metadata:
  name: git-connector
  namespace: git-connector-demo
spec:
  connectorClassName: git
  address: https://github.com  # Replace with your Git server address
  auth:
    name: basicAuth
    secretRef:
      name: git-auth
    params:
    - name: repository
      value: your-org/your-repo.git  # Replace with your repository path
EOF
```

Verify that the connector is in "Ready" status:

```bash
kubectl get connector git-connector -n git-connector-demo
```

The output should show:
```
NAME           CLASS   ADDRESS            READY   AGE
git-connector  git     https://github.com True    1m
```

### Step 3: Create a Clone Job

Create a job that uses the connector to clone the repository:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: git-clone
  namespace: git-connector-demo
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: git
        image: bitnami/git:2.47.1
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        command:
        - "git"
        args: [ "clone", "--progress", "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git", "/tmp/repo" ]  # Replace with your repo
        volumeMounts:
        - name: gitconfig
          mountPath: /root/
      volumes:
      - name: gitconfig
        csi:
          readOnly: true
          driver: connectors-csi
          volumeAttributes:
            connector.name: "git-connector"
            configuration.names: "gitconfig"
EOF
```

Key parameters:
- `connector.name`: The name of your Git connector
- `configuration.names`: Set to "gitconfig", which references a specific configuration template defined in the Git ConnectorClass. This template is used to generate the ".gitconfig" file with the appropriate settings for authentication and URL rewriting.
- `mountPath`: Must be set to "/root/" because the container runs as the root user, and Git will look for configuration in the "/root/.gitconfig" path

### Step 4: Verify Operation

Check the job's logs to confirm the repository was successfully cloned:

```bash
kubectl logs -f job/git-clone -n git-connector-demo
```

You should see the Git clone operation completing successfully without any authentication errors.

### Expected Results

After successfully completing all steps, you will see:

1. A Git connector in "Ready" status:
   ```
   NAME           CLASS   ADDRESS            READY   AGE
   git-connector  git     https://github.com True    5m
   ```

2. A successful Git clone operation in the job logs:
   ```
   Cloning into '/tmp/repo'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 1324, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (1324/1324), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (712/712), done.
   remote: Total 1324 (delta 612), reused 1324 (delta 612), pack-reused 0
   Receiving objects: 100% (1324/1324), 2.56 MiB | 4.25 MiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (612/612), done.
   ```

## How It Works

The Git Connector works by:

1. Replacing the original Git repository URL with a proxy service URL
2. Injecting authentication information into requests to the proxy service
3. The proxy service adding the necessary credentials when forwarding requests to the Git server

To examine the generated configuration:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: inspect-git-config
  namespace: git-connector-demo
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
  - name: git
    image: bitnami/git:2.47.1
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: gitconfig
      mountPath: /root/
  volumes:
  - name: gitconfig
    csi:
      readOnly: true
      driver: connectors-csi
      volumeAttributes:
        connector.name: "git-connector"
        configuration.names: "gitconfig"
EOF
```

View the generated configuration:

```bash
kubectl exec -it inspect-git-config -n git-connector-demo -- cat /root/.gitconfig
```

Example output:
```
[http]
    extraHeader = Authorization: Basic OmV5Smhixxxxxxxxx==
[url "http://c-git-connector.git-connector-demo.svc]
    insteadOf = https://github.com
```

## Troubleshooting

If your clone operation fails, check the following:

1. **Connector Status**: Ensure the connector is in "Ready" state:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe connector git-connector -n git-connector-demo
   ```

2. **RBAC Permissions**: Verify the RoleBinding is correctly configured.

3. **Job Configuration**:
   - Ensure the volume mount path is correct (/root/)
   - Verify the repository URL matches what's configured in the connector

## Next Steps

After successfully cloning your first repository using the Git Connector, you can:

- Integrate this approach into your CI/CD pipelines
- Use the connector in other Git operations like push, pull, and fetch
- Create connectors for different Git services
