# Introduction

## Connectors Git

**What is ConnectorsGit**

ConnectorsGit is a specialized connector component that enables secure and convenient integration with Git repositories. It extends the Connectors system with Git-specific capabilities, allowing users to interact with Git servers without directly handling credentials.

**Feature Overview**

ConnectorsGit provides several key capabilities:

- Secure access to Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) through credential abstraction
- Automatic credential injection for Git operations via CSI volumes
- Support for both HTTP/HTTPS authentication methods
- URL rewriting and proxy authentication for seamless integration

Once ConnectorsGit is deployed, users can:

- Create Git connectors to integrate with various Git repositories
- Clone, pull, and push to private repositories without directly handling credentials
- Configure repository-specific access permissions
- Use Git operations in CI/CD pipelines with enhanced security

**Advantages**

- **Enhanced Security**: Git credentials are centrally managed and never directly accessible to workloads
- **Simplified Operations**: Developers can perform Git operations without worrying about credential management
- **Unified Experience**: Consistent interface for working with different Git providers
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for various authentication methods, including username/password and SSH keys

**Application Scenarios**

- Securely cloning private repositories in CI/CD pipelines
- Displaying git references information from Git repositories in UI applications
- Seamless Git operations in container workloads without credential configuration
- Centralized management of Git access across multiple teams and projects
