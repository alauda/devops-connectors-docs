# Introduction

## Connectors OCI

**What is ConnectorsOCI**

ConnectorsOCI is a specialized connector component that facilitates secure and convenient integration with OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries. It extends the Connectors system with container registry-specific capabilities, enabling users to interact with image repositories without directly handling credentials.

**Feature Overview**

ConnectorsOCI provides several key capabilities:

- Secure access to container registries (Docker Hub, Harbor, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
- Configuration generation for various container tools (Docker, BuildKit, etc.)
- Automatic credential injection for registry operations via CSI volumes
- Proxy mechanism for registry authentication and access

Once ConnectorsOCI is deployed, users can:

- Create OCI connectors to integrate with various container registries
- Push and pull container images without directly handling registry credentials
- Configure registry-specific access permissions
- Use container operations in CI/CD pipelines with enhanced security

**Advantages**

- **Enhanced Security**: Registry credentials are centrally managed and never directly accessible to workloads
- **Simplified Operations**: Users can perform container operations without worrying about credential management
- **Multiple Tool Support**: Compatible with various container tools through specific configuration options
- **Seamless CI/CD Integration**: Facilitates secure image building and publishing in automated pipelines

**Application Scenarios**

- Building and pushing container images in CI/CD pipelines
- Managing container image access across multiple teams and projects
