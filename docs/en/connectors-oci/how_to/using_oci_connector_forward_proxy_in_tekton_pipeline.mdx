# Using OCI Connector Forward Proxy in Tekton Task

Using OCI Connector Forward Proxy in Tekton Tasks enables centralized management of OCI registry credentials and secure access to OCI registries during Tekton Task execution.

## Requirements for Tekton Task \{#requirements-for-tekton-task}

Not all Tekton Tasks can use OCI Connector Forward Proxy.

OCI Connector injects proxy configurations through a CSI Driver. It provides built-in configuration files for forward proxy usage:

- **`.env`**: Environment variables file containing `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` in `key=value` format
- **`http.proxy`**: Forward proxy URL with authentication for HTTP
- **`https.proxy`**: Forward proxy URL with authentication for HTTPS

**Therefore, Tekton Tasks must meet the following requirements to use OCI Connector Forward Proxy:**

**1. The CLI tools used in the Task must support HTTP proxy environment variables**

**2. The Task must support configuring HTTP proxy environment variables**.
> This can be done by:
> - Mounting a workspace containing a `.env` file
> - Using custom commands to read environment variables from files

**3. The Task must support configuring insecure registries**
> This can be done by:
> - Mounting a workspace containing a configuration file that supports insecure registries that connectorclass provides
> - Using cli arguments to configure insecure registries

## Usage Instructions

### Using Forward Proxy with .env Workspace

If the Task natively supports a workspace containing a `.env` file, you can directly mount the OCI Connector's built-in configurations via CSI.

In the following example, we use a `buildah` Task that accepts a `docker-config` workspace with a `.env` file containing `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: buildah-build-my-repo
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: buildah
  params:
    - name: IMAGES
      value:
        - registry.example.com/my-repo/my-image
    - name: TLS_VERIFY
      value: "false"
  workspaces:
    - name: source
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-source
    - name: docker-config
      csi:
        readOnly: true
        driver: connectors-csi
        volumeAttributes:
          connector.name: "oci-connector"
          configuration.names: "config"
```

### Using Forward Proxy with Custom Commands

If the Task does not natively support a `.env` workspace, but allows custom commands, you can source the `.env` file manually in the command.

In the following example, we use a `buildah-cli` Task that accepts a `cmd` parameter for custom shell commands. The Task mounts the `docker-config` workspace to `/workspace/docker-config`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: buildah-build-my-repo
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: buildah-cli
  workspaces:
    - name: docker-config
      csi:
        readOnly: true
        driver: connectors-csi
        volumeAttributes:
          connector.name: "oci-connector"
          configuration.names: "config"
  params:
    - name: cmd
      value: |
        source /workspace/docker-config/.env
        buildah push --tls-verify=false myimage registry.example.com/library/myimage:v1
```

> **Note:** The `--tls-verify=false` flag is required because the forward proxy intercepts and re-signs TLS traffic. Different CLI tools have different ways to configure insecure registries. Please refer to your CLI documentation for details.
